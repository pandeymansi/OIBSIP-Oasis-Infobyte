# Data Science Internship Projects
Welcome to my repository! This collection showcases the projects I completed during my data science internship. Each project demonstrates my ability to work with data, from processing and analyzing datasets to building predictive models and providing insights. Below are the highlights of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
In this project, I worked on classifying iris flower species based on their measurements. The dataset used contains measurements of iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal was to predict the species of the iris flowers.

* Objective: To accurately classify iris flower species.<br>
* Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook.

### 2. Spam Mail Prediction
This project focuses on distinguishing spam emails from non-spam (ham) emails. By analyzing the content of emails, I built a model that predicts whether an email is spam or not, aiming to reduce unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

* Objective: To identify and filter out spam emails.<br>
* Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook.

### 3. Unemployment Analysis
In this project, I explored and analyzed unemployment data. The goal was to gain insights into unemployment trends, factors influencing unemployment, and how these factors vary across different regions and time periods.

* Objective: To analyze unemployment trends and factors.<br>
* Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
